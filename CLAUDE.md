# CLAUDE.md

Guidance for Claude Code (claude.ai/code) working on this repository.

## Project Overview

Comprehensive database and analytics platform for Ottoneu Fantasy Football League 309 (12-team Superflex Half PPR). Python scripts scrape player data and NFL stats into a Supabase PostgreSQL database. A Next.js frontend provides interactive analytics and visualizations for player efficiency (PPG/PPS), VORP, surplus value, projected salaries, and arbitration targets.

**Package Manager:** Always use `npm` for frontend dependencies and scripts. Do not use `pnpm`, `yarn`, or `bun`.

**Python:** Always use `venv/bin/python` (not `python` or `python3`). The virtualenv is at `venv/`, not `.venv/`.

## Quick Reference

- **Commands:** See [docs/COMMANDS.md](docs/COMMANDS.md) for all CLI commands (frontend, backend, just recipes, cron)
- **Architecture:** See [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for system design, data pipeline, and analysis pipeline
- **Frontend:** See [docs/FRONTEND.md](docs/FRONTEND.md) for routes, components, types, and config
- **Code layout:** See [docs/CODE_ORGANIZATION.md](docs/CODE_ORGANIZATION.md) for key file locations and config
- **Database:** See [docs/generated/db-schema.md](docs/generated/db-schema.md) for table schemas and relationships
- **Testing:** See [docs/TESTING.md](docs/TESTING.md) for running Python and web tests
- **Git workflow:** See [docs/GIT_WORKFLOW.md](docs/GIT_WORKFLOW.md) for branch and PR requirements
- **Ottoneu rules:** See [docs/references/ottoneu-rules.md](docs/references/ottoneu-rules.md) for scoring, roster, salary cap, and arbitration rules
- **Environment:** See [docs/references/environment-variables.md](docs/references/environment-variables.md) for `.env` setup
- **Projection Accuracy Plan:** See [docs/exec-plans/projection-accuracy-improvement.md](docs/exec-plans/projection-accuracy-improvement.md) for the 4-phase accuracy improvement roadmap (Issues #271-#285)
- **Projection Accuracy:** Use `/projection-accuracy` skill (or run `python scripts/feature_projections/accuracy_report.py`) to generate a model comparison table. **Required when updating any projection code** — see Projection Model Update Requirements in [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md).
- **Projection Iteration:** Use `/experiment` to run a full experiment loop (train → project → backtest → verdict). Use `/ablation` for feature ablation studies, `/feature-importance` for learned model inspection, `/compare-models` for side-by-side comparisons, `/diagnose-segment` for segment deep-dives.
- **Experiment Log:** See [docs/generated/experiment-log.md](docs/generated/experiment-log.md) for history of all model iteration attempts.
- **Retrospective:** Use `/retro` skill after completing a task to surface friction points and open a PR with doc/skill improvements.

## GitHub Repository

When using GitHub MCP tools or `gh` CLI, the repository coordinates are:
- **Owner:** `alex-monroe`
- **Repo:** `ottoneu-db` (hyphen, not underscore)

Note: The local directory is `ottoneu_db` (underscore) but the GitHub repo name uses a hyphen.

## Critical Rules

- **Update documentation:** Always try to update the agent documentation after completing a task. Update existing documents or add new documents and sections as needed to reflect architectural or contextual changes.
- **Never commit directly to `main`.** All changes go through pull requests.
- **Always create a PR.** Every task must end with `gh pr create --fill`.
- **Start from updated main:** `git checkout main && git pull origin main` before branching.
- See [docs/GIT_WORKFLOW.md](docs/GIT_WORKFLOW.md) for full details.
